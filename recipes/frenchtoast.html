      better french toast <br> because it is drier and therefore absorbs the egg
      mixture better then fresh bread. French toast is a fast and high quality
      dish, only requiring a few common <br> household ingredients not much prep or cook time it is perfect for family breakfasts. Below
      is the best recipe anyone can find.
